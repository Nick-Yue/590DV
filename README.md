# 590DV Final Project

Introduction
In this project, I mainly used two datasets: Food Inspections, Public Health Statistics. For the Food Inspections dataset, I firstly created a bar plot that shows the number of restaurants in areas with different zip codes. Second, the interactive dashboard being the central visualization shows the overall restaurants' risk of adversely affecting the publicâ€™s health in different regions. For the Public Health Statistics dataset, I used Birth Rate, General Fertility Rate, Low Birth Weight Rate in it to indicate the public health conditions. By making the line plot of these three factors and restaurants' risk, I want to show whether there is a linkage between the food quality of restaurants and public health condition in these zip-code-devided areas.
